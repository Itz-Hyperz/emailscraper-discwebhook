# Email Scraper Discord Webhook
A simple Email Scraper I wrote that takes new emails and sends basic info about them to a Discord Webhook. I am currently using this for my schools emails, when we get them, if they are from the noreply email, they will log to a Discord embed for other students to see in our community Discord server.

# Prerequisites
- [NodeJS V16](https://nodejs.dev/)
- IMAP enabled via email client (gmail is what is used here)
- Less secure apps enabled via email client (gmail is what is used here)
- A Discord server w/Webhook information  

# Installation
1. Ensure you have all the prerequisites installed.
2. Download all files and unzip it.
3. Do any necessary configuration in the `config.js` file.
4. Open a new terminal and navigate to the root directory of this project.
5. Run `npm install` in the terminal to install all necessary dependencies.
6. Run `node main.js` and you're done!
